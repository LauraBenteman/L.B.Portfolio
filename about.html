    <p class="bodycopy">Hello There!</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">My name is Laura Benteman. I am acurrent senior at the University of Missouri studying Strategic Communication and Sociology.</p>


    <p>I'm strategic communicator who loves crafting stories that connect, inspire, and make people feel something real. I’ve always believed the strongest works are built where creativity meets real people, and my work reflects that blend across photography, writing, and client-focused strategy. </p>

    <p>  I’m passionate about understanding audiences and finding the right message for the right moment. Whether I’m developing a client pitch, writing content that sparks emotion, or capturing images that communicate without a single word, I approach every project with curiosity, intention, and a commitment to authentic storytelling. </p>

    <p> My background in Strategic Communications has taught me how to think critically, communicate effectively, and produce work that aligns with values and organizational goals. My experience in photography has sharpened my eye for detail and visual narrative, while my writing and pitch work have strengthened my voice and my ability to craft compelling, audience-centered messages. </p>

    <p> At my core, I’m someone who loves turning ideas into impactful stories — the kind that leave people with a feeling, a thought, or a desire to take action. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I’m excited to continue growing, creating, and collaborating with people who care about meaningful communication.</p>
